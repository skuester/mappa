# Object Mapper  (Work in Progress)

Map an object to and from another object. This is useful for things like mapping to or from database rows.


## Reason For Being

Most mappers available do not encapsulate both "directions" for mapping between one format and another. Also, most are not very simple, even thought they claim to be so.
